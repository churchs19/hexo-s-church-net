Today is the 25th anniversary of the 1980 US Olympic Hockey team's upset of the Soviet Union in the famous "Miracle on Ice" game.  I was reading a [piece by Greg Ebben on MSNBC](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6902610/#050222a) on the game today and a couple of things really struck me about how we can truly accomplish anything if we work hard and believe in what we're doing.  It is way too easy to become pessimistic about our surroundings and the direction our lives are going.  It is useful to look back at examples like this and realize that with a plan, guts, and determination, we can truly accomplish miracles.
