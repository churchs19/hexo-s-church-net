This past weekend I visited Andrea in Buffalo.  I got in late Thursday night and then we relaxed and ran errands on Friday before going to her Bar and Bench night for PAD at Bennigan's.  This particular Bennigan's easily won the award for the worst restaurant customer service I have ever seen for a number of slights over the course of about 2 hours.  After that, we rented "[Shall We Dance](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=shanechurch-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/B0006GAI6Y/qid=1127151516/sr=8-4/ref=pd_bbs_4?v=glance)" and then watched the movie for the rest of the night.

On Saturday, we got up and drove up to Niagara-on-the-Lake to get some wine at [Peller Estates](http://www.peller.com/) before heading up to Toronto to watch the [Blue Jays](http://www.bluejays.com/) play the [Yankees](http://www.yankees.com/) at [Rogers Centre](http://www.rogerscentre.com/).  In a [great game](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=250917114), we watched Shawn Chacon of the Yankees (formerly of the Rockies) outduel Gustavo Chacin of the Jays 1-0.  The game was my first American League game and the atmosphere in the packed Rogers Centre was a lot of fun.  Following the game we drove back to Buffalo and had dinner at [Chef's](http://www.ilovechefs.com/).  After dinner we were listening to the UB-Rutgers game on the radio and decided that since UB was still in the game and the fireworks hadn't happened yet, that we would go use the free tickets Andrea had to watch the fireworks and the second half of the game.  We got to UB Stadium right as the fireworks were starting and then stayed for the second half of [UB's 17-3 loss to Rutgers](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=252602084).  After having attended games at a number of "big time" college football venues including CU, USC, Nebraska, and Kansas State, I was amazed at how "high school" the game atmosphere at UB is, though I guess I shouldn't be too surprised given that ESPN calls UB the [worst Division I-A team in the country](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2160168).

Sunday was another lazy day as I helped Andrea back up her iTunes library to DVD and then we watched some movies on the UB cable system before I had to fly back to Denver.  <!--Photos from the weekend are on my [photo page](http://wwwazure.s-church.net/PhotoAlbum).-->
