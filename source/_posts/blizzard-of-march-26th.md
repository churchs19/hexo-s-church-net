Yesterday's forecast proved to be very accurate.  We ended up getting 15 inches of heavy, wet snow here at the house.  About 10 of those inches fell between about 9 am and 1 pm.  It was pretty crazy.  I ended up clearing the driveway three times yesterday and once more this morning.  I've got a couple of huge piles of snow on either side of the driveway from clearing enough so that Andrea and I can get out to the street.  But being typical Colorado, the sun is shining today and the melt is well underway.
