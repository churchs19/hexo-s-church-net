It's official.  This morning was my 30th birthday.  I woke up to what seems to be an annual birthday tradition: a snowstorm.  We ended up getting 5 or 6 inches of snow here at the house and I worked from home this morning, but I'm going to head to work around noon now that the snow has stopped and the traffic has cleared.

On Saturday night, Andrea threw a wonderful birthday party for me.  We had about 40 people over, including family, friends, friends from church, and former coworkers.  We had a ton of great food, though my chile rellenos were clearly the hit of the party.  The party started around 6 pm and the last people left around 1 am.  It really was a great time.
