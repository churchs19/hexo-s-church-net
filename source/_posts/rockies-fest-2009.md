This past Saturday, January 24, was Rockies Fest 2009 at Coors Field.  The event was the first that the Rockies have ever done and was only open to the first 5000 season ticket holders that responded.  Dave and I went with our two tickets and Lauren and Cora used Lauren's.  We all got to Coors Field right at 10 when they opened the gates.  During the day we went to an interview session with the Rockies' MLB outfielders (Ryan Spilborghs, Brad Hawpe, Carlos Gonzalez, Seth Smith, and Scott Podsednik) and later snuck into a session with the MLB Infielders (Garrett Atkins, Troy Tulowitzki, Jeff Baker, Ian Stewart, Joe Koshansky, Clint Barmes, Omar Quintanilla, and Todd Helton).  Dave's autograph ticket got him 3B Ian Stewart's and 2B Jeff Baker's  autographs and mine got P Ubaldo Jimenez's and P Glendon Rusch's.  We also got autographs from about 15 of the Rockies' top minor league prospects.  During the day, they also had all of the broadcast booths, the owner's suite, the Rockies's clubhouse, and the famous humidor open to tour.  The Rockies' clubhouse was definitely one of the highlights of the day since that isn't even open to the normal Coors Field tours.  It was really an amazing day full of the Rockies and totally worth the time and effort to get the tickets.
