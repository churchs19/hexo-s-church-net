            I am a UX-focused software developer and architect specializing in
            JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C#, ASP.NET, and Node.js. I am currently a

            Energyâ€™s Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, Visa, Rambus,
            National Oilwell Varco, and more. I wrote an article on developing
            hybrid mobile applications that was published in MSDN Magazine. I

            I have two wonderful sons, Ethan, 10, and Colin, 5, with my
            beautiful wife, Andrea. I enjoy bicycling, baseball, and playing
            Lego with the boys, and I love to travel whenever the opportunity
            presents itself.
