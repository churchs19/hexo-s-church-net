            I am a versatile UX-focused software engineer and architect with
            extensive experience in full-stack development, team leadership, and
            system design. As a Senior Software Engineer at Vermeer, I
            specialize in crafting innovative solutions using cutting-edge
            technologies like Vue.js, Angular, .NET, and Azure. My career has
            taken me through impactful roles at various companies, where I've
            honed my skills in mentoring developers, debugging complex systems,
            and enhancing user experiences. Beyond my professional work, I
            actively contribute to the tech community and pursue personal
            projects, blending my technical expertise with a passion for
            creative, user-centered development.

            I have three wonderful sons, Ethan, 14, and Colin, 10, and Owen, 3,
            with my beautiful wife, Andrea. I enjoy bicycling, baseball, and
            playing Lego with the boys, and I love to travel whenever the
            opportunity presents itself.
